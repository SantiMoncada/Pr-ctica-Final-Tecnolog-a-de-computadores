2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell state[1]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) state_reg[0]/CLR, state_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell state_reg[2]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) state_reg[2]_C/CLR, state_reg[2]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
